      <p>NodeSchool is a fully community driven effort and is 100% open source. This means that anyone can use the NodeSchool materials and/or host an event.</p>

      <h3>Hosting Suggestions</h3>
      <p>As you can see from the above writeups there is a lot of flexiblity in the specifics of running an event, but we have found some of the following suggestions to be universally helpful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try and get a mentor:student ratio of around 1:5 or more</li>
        <li>Send attendees a reminder email the day/night before to increase turnout</li>
        <li>Reach out to a wider group of potential attendees to encourage a more diverse turnout</li>
        <li>Adopt a code of conduct for the event to help create a safe space and to minimize potential harassment scenarios</li>
        <li>If you are unsure if your venue has adequate WiFi capacity then have an offline plan (e.g. thumbdrives)</li>
        <li>If needed reach out to local software companies etc and ask for donations of space, wifi, food and drinks</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Add Your Event!</h3>
      <p>NodeSchool events are kept in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/github.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuOjlXjUrSbAdE1XRFJkeEJZQ1NSelhILUR0NXdBWUE#gid=0" target="blank">this Google Spreadsheet</a>.
